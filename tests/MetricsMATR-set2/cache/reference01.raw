 Palestinian Liberation Organization: Expansion of Settlements Wrecks Opportunities to Achieve Peace in the Region  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/1)
 By Nasser Abu Bakr  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/2)
 Ramallah (West Bank) 15-2 (AFP) - The Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization today, Wednesday, regarded the expansion of Israeli settlements as wrecking opportunities to achieve peace in the region and reiterated its full commitment to all agreements signed with the Israeli government under international patronage.  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/3)
 It stated its "outright rejection of these settlement plans which are tearing up our Palestinian land into isolated cantons to stop our people from establishing an independent state."  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/5)
 The statement went on to say that "the Executive Committee has turned to the quadripartite committee that created the road map to inform it of our position on this creeping settlement on our land and the need for it to play its role in the peace process and the two-state (establishment) solution."  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/6)
 It went on to say that "the continued settlement of Holy Jerusalem, the racist separation wall and isolation of the Al-Aghwar area in an attempt to make it Jewish, as well as the crimes of assassination, violations and detentions only wreck any chance of establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East."  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/7)
 It added, "It has been decided to hold a meeting of the Supreme Council under Saleem Al-Zanoun(Abu Al-Adib), president of Ramallah's national council, this week to discuss current preparations for convening the Central Palestinian Council and to approve plans and decisions prepared by the Supreme Council to activate the organization, the executive committee and specific departments."

(AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/11)
 He added, "The Executive Committee confirms that members of the Legislative Council are members of the National Council. With this, the Hamas movement enters the Palestinian National Council which is considered to be the Palestinian Liberation Organization's parliament and this also qualifies it to join all the Organization's institutions which the Hamas movement was previously cautious about joining."  (AFP_ARB_20060215.0128/13)

 By Christian Spielmann  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/2)
 Rome 2-18 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi battled with his allies in the Northern League today, Saturday, to be allowed to sack one of his top men, Reform Minister Roberto Calderoli, in order to ease tensions caused by his offensive statements about Islam in the Muslim world.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/3)
 The Prime Minister asked Calderoli to resign but stressed on the same day, Saturday, that he had "no authority to force him" to do so.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/4)
 The minister in question responded by saying that he was prepared to resign "if Umberto Bossi (leader of the Northern League) asks me to do so and if the Muslim world makes a conciliatory gesture."  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/5)
 The Italian minister is accused of insulting Islam by wearing a T-shirt with the offensive cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed which led to a dangerous international crisis. He wore the T-shirt on Thursday and appeared in it on the evening news on Italy's Channel "RAI Uno".  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/6)
 This action and further accusations against Islam he made in press statements on Friday led to violent anti-Italian demonstrations in Libya in which 10 people were killed on Friday.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/7)
 Roberto Calderoli does not intend to apologize. The newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported today, Saturday, that he said "I don't feel responsible for those deaths."  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/8)
 He stressed in a statement to the newspaper La Repubblica that "western civilization is under threat."  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/9)
 Silvio Berlusconi caused shock waves in the Muslim world when he stated that "western civilization is superior". This was on September 26, 2001, two weeks after the attacks in the United States. He faced a great deal of difficulty in making amends for these statements.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/10)
 Calderoli (49 years old), a former specialist maxillofacial surgeon, is seen as an extremely conservative member of the Northern League, a movement that is against foreigners and allied to Berlusconi.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/11)
 He came into the government in July 2004 to replace Bossi, the leader of the League, who was forced to resign after a heart attack. The League runs three ministries: the Justice, Labor and Reform Ministries.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/12)
 Roberto Calderoli says he enjoys the support of Umberto Bossi and his party, as well as "the support of many who think like me."  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/13)
 He bragged to La Repubblica newspaper, "Silvio Berlusconi has asked for my resignation but I haven't resigned yet."  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/14)
 The Italian authorities fear more anti-Italian demonstrations today, Saturday, in the Muslim world in addition to repercussions in Italy.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/15)
 Berlusconi announced that he had asked Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisano to provide security for the Northern League's offices and said that "protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Italian missions abroad."  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/16)
 Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianfranco Fini, announced his intention to visit a mosque in Rome today, Saturday, in an effort to ease the tension caused by Calderoli's statements.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/17)
 This is not the first time the prime minister has clashed with the Northern League in asking for the resignation of one of its ministers from government.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/18)
 In July 2003, he was forced to negotiate with Umberto Bossi on the matter of the resignation of Tourism Minister Stefano Stefani who made offensive statements about German tourists.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/19)
 The confrontation lasted a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with Germany which were in trouble anyway because of insults Silvio Berlusconi made personally about a German deputy whom he compared to a Nazi prison guard.  (AFP_ARB_20060218.0099/20)
 This new crisis comes at a sensitive phase for the prime minister who is submerged in a difficult campaign for the legislative elections to be held on April 19.

 Many recommendations have been made by conservative research centers and think-tanks which support the Republican administration in the White House calling on it "not to put pressure on Arab regimes" and to stop backing "the tendency to impose the model of democratization in Eastern Europe on countries in the Muslim world."  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/10)
 Opponents of democratization in the Muslim Arab world link the Hamas victory to the election gains made by the fundamentalist movement in the Iranian elections and to Muslim Brotherhood candidates winning five seats in parliament for the first time in Egypt.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/11)
 Security and military alliance  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/12)
 According to the Financial Times and many European and American sources, "in spite of the criticisms made by the administration of the Egyptian regime because of its legal violations during the last legislative elections", the American budget for 2007 expects to see an increase in the amount of military and security aid to Cairo since it sees it as "an ally in the war on terror."...

 Hamas' alliance with Washington's enemies  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/15)
 This debate, which will continue in the European and American media, will be heightened by several issues including:  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/16)
 * The backing of certain countries, which Washington and some European capitals regard as major enemies, for the Hamas movement (and its forthcoming government), particularly Syria, Iran, Sudan, Russia and Venezuela, with the list possibly increasing to include other countries such as Cuba, Korea, China and several Arab and Muslim countries.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/17)
 * The objective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing and many European and Asian countries against sanctions on Iran because of the Iranian nuclear portfolio,  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/18)
 and Tehran's foreign policy after Ahmadinejad's victory and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement led by Mohammed Khatami and former Culture Minister Mahajrani.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/19)
 * The failure of most of Washington's liberal and secular allies in the Iraqi elections.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/20)
 The battle in the elections, the political game and the Iraqi security conflicts is played out between Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish movements, parties and groups with many contradiction between them but the overwhelming majority of them have religious overtones...  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/21)
 and do not distinguish between religion and politics.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/22)
 * Continued security concerns and the series of suicide attacks against American and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of Americans dead and wounded in 2005 alone) and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine...  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/23)
 in spite of the pro-reform and democracy projects adopted by President Bush's administration over the years.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/24)
 This means that these projects have not as yet helped to improve the image the general public and radical movements in the "Greater Middle East" have of Washington and its policies in the region.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/25)
 Resolutions from the Georgia and Istanbul summits  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/26)
 It may be premature to expect Washington to back down from its big project - also adopted by the Group of Eight at the Georgia summit and the Atlantic alliance summit in Istanbul in 2004 - which aims at re-enacting the Eastern European picture in the Arab Islamic world.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/27)
 However, there are several indicators that reveal the hesitation of many American and European decision-makers in continuing to support the "democratic reform" project  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/28)
 if such a democracy leads to the appearance of forces opposed to the strategic interests of Washington and its allies in the region  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/29)
 and in the world,  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/30)
 starting with Israel's interests.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/31)
 If this hesitation continues, the priority of Washington and its allies will again be security and military priorities and not political ones...  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/32)
 in spite of the public statements made repeatedly by President Bush Junior and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell and current Secretary of State Rice which deem one of the reasons for the appearance of anti-American and western terrorist movements to be its 60 year long support for the security option at the price of freedom and democracy.
