 And according to the British newspaper Financial Times, the Administration of the American President George Bush "is currently reconsidering its declared plans for spreading democracy in the Middle East region after the crushing victory of the Islamic Movement Hamas in the latest Palestinian legislative elections."  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/6)
 The newspaper reported that the neo-conservatives close to the American President have begun reviewing their plans to spread democracy in the Middle East after the sweeping victory of the Hamas Movement.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/7)
 It added that since the results of those elections appeared, there is "a flood of reports and studies pouring on the Bush Administration advising it to exercise caution and slow down on the issue of spreading democracy in the Middle East."  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/8)
 Stop pressuring the regimes  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/9)
 Similarly, several recommendations were issued by conservative research centers and think tanks that support the Republican Administration in the White House urging it to "not put pressure on the Arab regimes" and stop supporting the "tendency to impose the model of spreading democracy in Eastern Europe on the countries of the Islamic region."  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/10)
 The adherents of the position that is against the democratization of the Arab Islamic region link the victory of Hamas and the electoral gains garnered by the extremist wing in the elections of Iran with the victory of the candidates of the Moslem Brotherhood organization with five seats in Parliament for the first time in Egypt..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/11)
 Security and military alliance  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/12)
 According to the Financial Times and many European and American sources, "in spite of the criticisms directed by the administration at the Egyptian regime because of its violations of the law during the latest legislative elections," the American budget of 2007 anticipates an increase in the volume of military and security assistance that Washington provides to Cairo since it is "an important ally in the war on terrorism.."  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/13)
 Which means that the priority for Washington and its European allies will be security and not politics.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/14)
 Alliance of Hamas with Washington's opponents  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/15)
 This debate that will continue in the European and American media is intensified by many issues, of which:  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/16)
 * The support by some countries which Washington and some European capitals consider to be major opponents, to Hamas (and its upcoming government), particularly Syria, Iran, Sudan, Russia and Venezuela, and the list could extend to include other countries such as Cuba, Korea, China and several Arab and Islamic countries..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/17)
 * The objective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing and many of the countries of Europe and the Asian countries against the option of a siege of Iran because of the Iranian nuclear issue..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/18)
 Tehran's foreign policy after the victory of Ahmadinejad and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement under the leadership of Mohammad Khatami and his former Minister of Education Mahajerani..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/19)
 * The failure of the majority of Washington's liberal and secular allies in Iraqi elections..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/20)
 and the centering of the conflict in the elections, the political game and the security battles between Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish movements, parties and groups that have many contradictions, the vast majority of which have a religious character.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/21)
 ..and do not distinguish between religion and politics  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/22)
 * The persistence of the security unrest and the waves of suicide attacks against American and Allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of dead and wounded Americans in 2005 alone), and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/23)
 in spite of the projects in support of reform and democracy that have been adopted by the administration of President Bush for years..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/24)
 Which means that those projects have not yet helped to improve the general opinion among the people and the radical movements in "the Greater Middle East" of Washington and its policies in the region.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/25)
 The resolutions of the Georgia and Istanbul summits  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/26)
 It may be premature to expect a final retreat by Washington from its great project - which was adopted by the Group of Eight also at the Georgia Summit and the Atlantic Alliance in Istanbul in 2004 - and which aims at repeating the Eastern European scenario in the Arab Islamic world..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/27)
 But many indicators show a great hesitation by American and European decision makers to continue supporting the "democratic reform" project..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/28)
 if this democracy will spawn forces that are hostile to the strategic interests of Washington and its allies in the region..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/29)
 and in the world..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/30)
 beginning with the interests of Israel..  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/31)
 And if this hesitation continues, the priority of Washington and its allies will again be military security and not politics.  (ASB_ARB_20060216.0010/32)
 in spite of public statements that were repeatedly issued by President Bush the son and his two Secretaries of State, the former, Colin Powell, and the current, Rice, which considered that one of the reasons for the emergence of terrorist movements hostile to America and the West is their support for the past 60 years of the security option at the expense of freedoms and democracy.
