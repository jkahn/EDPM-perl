</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Oslo 2-6 (AFP) - Terje Roed-Larsen, the former United Nations Middle East envoy, considered the situation in the region as having never been as dangerous as it is today and compared the region to a "powder keg with a lit fuse". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Roed-Larsen, speaking to the Norwegian NRK radio station said that "the region can now be compared in several respects to a powder keg with a lit fuse." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added "I think the situation is more difficult, complicated and dangerous than it has been for a number of decades." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Among the existing and potential crises in the Middle East, Roed-Larsen mentioned the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Iranian nuclear portfolio and the crisis between Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said that "all this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions which make the situation more likely to get out of control at any moment than it has been in the last few days." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Roed-Larsen did not openly mention the acts of violence that permeated demonstrations in the Muslim world in protest against the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in the European press, limiting himself to emphasizing the need for "dialogue" rather than "throwing stones and lighting fires." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Demonstrators set fire to the Danish and Norwegian embassy buildings in Damascus on Saturday while a building housing the Danish embassy in Beirut was set on fire in response to the publication of the caricatures in September in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and their subsequent republication in the European media, led by the Norwegian magazine Magazinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Roed-Larsen is currently in charge of monitoring the implementation of Security Council resolution 1559 which stipulates the disarmament of militias and armed groups in Lebanon, including, in the international organization's opinion, the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and Palestinian groups. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem 2-10 (AFP) - The Israeli Education Minister Meir Sheetrit said today, Friday, that the Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to the Hamas leadership to visit Moscow was "a stab in the back" to Israel. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Birmingham (United States) 2-13 (AFP) - Ten churches were burned down in 10 days in the state of Alabama in the southern United States. Police suspect two men without knowing the motives for these acts which were reminiscent of racist acts in the past.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The most recent criminal act today, Saturday, was the burning of the Beaverton Freewill Baptist Church 145 km northwest of the town of Birmingham. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The authorities quickly announced a link between previous acts of arson and this incident, the tenth of its kind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> There were no victims in these incidents but they did cause massive damage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The series of incidents began with the burning of five churches in Bibb County on February 3rd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Four days later, four more churches in three other neighboring counties to the west of Alabama were burned down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Police, who have many leads, are looking for two white persons, in their 20s or 30s with a blue car seen near the churches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The police announced a reward of 20,000 dollars for assistance in the arrest of the culprits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> At present, investigators can only guess the motives of the perpetrators of these acts and believe the perpetrators are trying to attract media attention. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the 1950s and 1960s, many churches frequented by blacks were targeted in the state of Alabama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The wave of churches frequented mainly by blacks being burned down began in 1995 and 1996 when over 30 religious establishments were set fire to in Tennessee, Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina. </seg>

<seg id="2"> By Nasser Abu Bakr </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Ramallah (West Bank) 15-2 (AFP) - The Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization today, Wednesday, regarded the expansion of Israeli settlements as wrecking opportunities to achieve peace in the region and reiterated its full commitment to all agreements signed with the Israeli government under international patronage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It stated its "outright rejection of these settlement plans which are tearing up our Palestinian land into isolated cantons to stop our people from establishing an independent state." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement went on to say that "the Executive Committee has turned to the quadripartite committee that created the road map to inform it of our position on this creeping settlement on our land and the need for it to play its role in the peace process and the two-state (establishment) solution." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It went on to say that "the continued settlement of Holy Jerusalem, the racist separation wall and isolation of the Al-Aghwar area in an attempt to make it Jewish, as well as the crimes of assassination, violations and detentions only wreck any chance of establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added, "It has been decided to hold a meeting of the Supreme Council under Saleem Al-Zanoun(Abu Al-Adib), president of Ramallah's national council, this week to discuss current preparations for convening the Central Palestinian Council and to approve plans and decisions prepared by the Supreme Council to activate the organization, the executive committee and specific departments." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The statement said the committee "discussed the forthcoming meeting of the Palestinian Legislative Council to be held on Saturday" and declared a "total commitment to all national principles approved by successive Palestinian national councils, as well as commitment to the Palestinian Liberation Organization's political program and the 1988 declaration of independence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It confirmed "its total commitment to all political agreements signed with the government of Israel under international patronage as well as abiding by international legal resolutions relating to the Palestinian issue, especially resolution 194 concerning the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the decisions of the Arab summit in Beirut." </seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He added, "The Executive Committee confirms that members of the Legislative Council are members of the National Council. With this, the Hamas movement enters the Palestinian National Council which is considered to be the Palestinian Liberation Organization's parliament and this also qualifies it to join all the Organization's institutions which the Hamas movement was previously cautious about joining." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Berlusconi Faces Difficulty in Sacking Minister Accused of Insulting Islam </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Christian Spielmann </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rome 2-18 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi battled with his allies in the Northern League today, Saturday, to be allowed to sack one of his top men, Reform Minister Roberto Calderoli, in order to ease tensions caused by his offensive statements about Islam in the Muslim world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Prime Minister asked Calderoli to resign but stressed on the same day, Saturday, that he had "no authority to force him" to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The minister in question responded by saying that he was prepared to resign "if Umberto Bossi (leader of the Northern League) asks me to do so and if the Muslim world makes a conciliatory gesture." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Italian minister is accused of insulting Islam by wearing a T-shirt with the offensive cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed which led to a dangerous international crisis. He wore the T-shirt on Thursday and appeared in it on the evening news on Italy's Channel "RAI Uno". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This action and further accusations against Islam he made in press statements on Friday led to violent anti-Italian demonstrations in Libya in which 10 people were killed on Friday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Roberto Calderoli does not intend to apologize. The newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported today, Saturday, that he said "I don't feel responsible for those deaths." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He stressed in a statement to the newspaper La Repubblica that "western civilization is under threat." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Silvio Berlusconi caused shock waves in the Muslim world when he stated that "western civilization is superior". This was on September 26, 2001, two weeks after the attacks in the United States. He faced a great deal of difficulty in making amends for these statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Calderoli (49 years old), a former specialist maxillofacial surgeon, is seen as an extremely conservative member of the Northern League, a movement that is against foreigners and allied to Berlusconi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He came into the government in July 2004 to replace Bossi, the leader of the League, who was forced to resign after a heart attack. The League runs three ministries: the Justice, Labor and Reform Ministries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Roberto Calderoli says he enjoys the support of Umberto Bossi and his party, as well as "the support of many who think like me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He bragged to La Repubblica newspaper, "Silvio Berlusconi has asked for my resignation but I haven't resigned yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Italian authorities fear more anti-Italian demonstrations today, Saturday, in the Muslim world in addition to repercussions in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Berlusconi announced that he had asked Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisano to provide security for the Northern League's offices and said that "protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Italian missions abroad." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianfranco Fini, announced his intention to visit a mosque in Rome today, Saturday, in an effort to ease the tension caused by Calderoli's statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This is not the first time the prime minister has clashed with the Northern League in asking for the resignation of one of its ministers from government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In July 2003, he was forced to negotiate with Umberto Bossi on the matter of the resignation of Tourism Minister Stefano Stefani who made offensive statements about German tourists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The confrontation lasted a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with Germany which were in trouble anyway because of insults Silvio Berlusconi made personally about a German deputy whom he compared to a Nazi prison guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> This new crisis comes at a sensitive phase for the prime minister who is submerged in a difficult campaign for the legislative elections to be held on April 19. Maurizio Gaspari, a National Alliance leader (right), said that the crisis "has come at a time when our position in opinion polls has started to improve ." </seg>

<seg id="6"> According to the British newspaper the Financial Times, President George Bush's administration "is currently reviewing its stated plans to spread democracy in the Middle East region after the overwhelming victory of the Hamas Islamic movement in the recent Palestinian legislative elections." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The newspaper reported that neo-Conservatives close to the American president have started to back down from plans to spread democracy in the Middle East after the overwhelming victory by the Hamas movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added that since the results of these elections were announced, "a flurry of reports and studies have been pouring in to the Bush administration advising it to take its time and slow down on the issue of spreading democracy in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Ending the pressure on regimes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Many recommendations have been made by conservative research centers and think-tanks which support the Republican administration in the White House calling on it "not to put pressure on Arab regimes" and to stop backing "the tendency to impose the model of democratization in Eastern Europe on countries in the Muslim world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Opponents of democratization in the Muslim Arab world link the Hamas victory to the election gains made by the fundamentalist movement in the Iranian elections and to Muslim Brotherhood candidates winning five seats in parliament for the first time in Egypt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Security and military alliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the Financial Times and many European and American sources, "in spite of the criticisms made by the administration of the Egyptian regime because of its legal violations during the last legislative elections", the American budget for 2007 expects to see an increase in the amount of military and security aid to Cairo since it sees it as "an ally in the war on terror."... </seg>
<seg id="14"> In other words, Washington and its European allies' priority will be security rather than politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Hamas' alliance with Washington's enemies </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> This debate, which will continue in the European and American media, will be heightened by several issues including: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> * The backing of certain countries, which Washington and some European capitals regard as major enemies, for the Hamas movement (and its forthcoming government), particularly Syria, Iran, Sudan, Russia and Venezuela, with the list possibly increasing to include other countries such as Cuba, Korea, China and several Arab and Muslim countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> * The objective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing and many European and Asian countries against sanctions on Iran because of the Iranian nuclear portfolio, </seg>
<seg id="19"> and Tehran's foreign policy after Ahmadinejad's victory and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement led by Mohammed Khatami and former Culture Minister Mahajrani. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> * The failure of most of Washington's liberal and secular allies in the Iraqi elections. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The battle in the elections, the political game and the Iraqi security conflicts is played out between Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish movements, parties and groups with many contradiction between them but the overwhelming majority of them have religious overtones... </seg>
<seg id="22"> and do not distinguish between religion and politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> * Continued security concerns and the series of suicide attacks against American and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of Americans dead and wounded in 2005 alone) and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine... </seg>
<seg id="24"> in spite of the pro-reform and democracy projects adopted by President Bush's administration over the years. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This means that these projects have not as yet helped to improve the image the general public and radical movements in the "Greater Middle East" have of Washington and its policies in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Resolutions from the Georgia and Istanbul summits </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It may be premature to expect Washington to back down from its big project - also adopted by the Group of Eight at the Georgia summit and the Atlantic alliance summit in Istanbul in 2004 - which aims at re-enacting the Eastern European picture in the Arab Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, there are several indicators that reveal the hesitation of many American and European decision-makers in continuing to support the "democratic reform" project </seg>
<seg id="29"> if such a democracy leads to the appearance of forces opposed to the strategic interests of Washington and its allies in the region </seg>
<seg id="30"> and in the world, </seg>
<seg id="31"> starting with Israel's interests. </seg>
<seg id="32"> If this hesitation continues, the priority of Washington and its allies will again be security and military priorities and not political ones... </seg>
<seg id="33"> in spite of the public statements made repeatedly by President Bush Junior and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell and current Secretary of State Rice which deem one of the reasons for the appearance of anti-American and western terrorist movements to be its 60 year long support for the security option at the price of freedom and democracy. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Ramallah February 9 /Xinhua/ Nabil Abu Radina, the spokesman for the Palestinian leadership, said today, Monday, that the Palestinian National Authority does not agree to Israel or any other party imposing unilateral solutions on it and added that the road to security and peace is through negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Abu Radina said in statements to journalists after a meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and James Wolfenson, the international Quartet committee's envoy, at the presidential headquarters in Ramallah on the West Bank, that "the official position is the unchanging position that we will not accept any unilateral solutions. A just and comprehensive settlement must include our land occupied in 1967, including Holy Jerusalem." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added, "We will not accept any final borders except through negotiation and we will not accept any partial solution or solutions imposed on us by any side. What is important is that Israel understands that the road to security and peace is through negotiations in accordance with international law and the return of land occupied in 1967." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He said that the future government would have to adopt the Liberation Organization's policy and its political agenda over the coming years, and pointed out that there was a clear danger that if the government did not comply with this, it would "isolate us and the world will not deal with us." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He stressed that imposing sanctions on the Palestinian people was a wrong decision but that the future Palestinian government would have to harmonize with the Liberation Organization's official policy to prevent it from becoming isolated and in a state of confusion and to avoid being in a position where it would not be able to meet the needs of its people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He said that Wolfenson had promised that support and help would continue but that Wolfenson and the whole world were held back by the Quartet committee's decisions. He said there was a way in which to deal with any Palestinian government and called on the international community to wait until the future government is formed and not to impose sanctions on the Palestinian people so as not to make matters even worse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In reply to a question about the formation of the future government, Abu Radina said there were no specific issues at the moment and indicated that the Legislative Committee would be set up then President Abbas would ask a colleague from the Hamas movement to form a government and that the president would give a speech to outline the features of the future policy. </seg>
