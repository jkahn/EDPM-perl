 He said that "all this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions which make the situation more likely to get out of control at any moment than it has been in the last few days."  (AFP_ARB_20060206.0155/6)
 Roed-Larsen did not openly mention the acts of violence that permeated demonstrations in the Muslim world in protest against the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in the European press, limiting himself to emphasizing the need for "dialogue" rather than "throwing stones and lighting fires."

 Demonstrators set fire to the Danish and Norwegian embassy buildings in Damascus on Saturday while a building housing the Danish embassy in Beirut was set on fire in response to the publication of the caricatures in September in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and their subsequent republication in the European media, led by the Norwegian magazine Magazinet.
