 He said: "All this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions that make the situation more vulnerable to getting out of control at any moment than it has in recent days."  (AFP_ARB_20060206.0155/6)
 Roed-Larsen did not explicitly mention the acts of violence that occurred during demonstrations in the Islamic world in protest against the publication in European newspapers of cartoons about the Prophet Mohammad, but only emphasized the necessity of "dialogue" instead of "throwing stones and lighting fires."

 Demonstrators burned the two buildings of the Danish and Norwegian Embassies in Damascus on Saturday, whereas a building housing an office of the Danish Embassy in Beirut was burned, in reaction to the publication in September of drawings in the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten and their subsequent re-publication in a number of European media channels led by the Norwegian magazine "Magasinet."

 Roed-Larsen is currently in charge of monitoring the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1559 that stipulates the disarming of militias and armed groups in Lebanon, including, according to that international organization, the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and Palestinian groups.
